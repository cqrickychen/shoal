# About

Welcome to the Shoal project. 

Shoal is a java based scalable dynamic 
clustering framework that provides infrastructure to build fault 
tolerance, reliability and availability.

The framework can be plugged into any product needing clustering 
and related distributed systems capabilities without tightly binding 
to a specific communications infrastructure.
